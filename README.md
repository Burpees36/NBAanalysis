# NBAanalysis
This was part of my statistcs course where I acted as a data analysist for an NBA team. The purpose of this analysis is to look at key performance metrics to allow the coach to make better decisions to improve the teamâ€™s performance. I used numpy and pandas in Python to gather relevant data which was then covered in the report. This was a my first time working with data in Python and found it very enjoyable to create visualizations for the data I was working with. Through this project I learned how to perform statistical analysis and how to convert those findings into something digestable for those not in the tech world.
